     <a href="https://www.roblox.com/">Roblox Platform</a>
    <p>There are many games on Roblox. I mean a <strong>LOT</strong>. So much so that most aren't even good quality/have 0 concurrent players. Some games have events with the developers hosting admin abuse, <small>(giving the players free op stuff)</small> reaching tens of millions of players, crashing the servers. </p>
    <p>It's funny what games get hundreds of thousands of players, as the best quality games on the platform get roughly a few thousand or less. There are also many games on Roblox that are rip-offs from steam games, as you might know <em>Peak</em>, it has a Roblox dupe called <em>Cliff</em>. This is one of many different game concepts copied, as well as Roblox developers aren't safe either.. Many games copy the format of popular game hits: Grow a ____, and Steal a _____. These are both very popular Roblox games, even breaking the concurrent active players record (now its 25.3m).</p>
