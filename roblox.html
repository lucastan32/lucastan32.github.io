  <p>There are many different arising problems regarding Roblox's AI obsession for moderation.</p>
  <p>Some of these problems have concluded with:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>A sudden <strong>decrease</strong> in stock value</li>
    <li>Countries <strong>banning</strong> the platform due to <em>child safety concerns</em></li>
    <li>Many <strong>innocent</strong> players getting banned because of the <small>AI moderation</small> not working <small>as they are trying to cut back on moderation and only please investors</small></li>
  </ol>
