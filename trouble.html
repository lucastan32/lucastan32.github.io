<h1>Welcome to Alpaca Adventures</h1>
<p>Alpacas live in the mountains of Peru and are known for their soft wool and gentle
personalities. They travel in groups called herds.</p>
</div>                                                     <!--One closing /div tags was missing, which caused layout issues by leaving container elements unclosed. This can break styling and structure, especially in nested layouts.-->

<div id="wool" class="section dark">                                <!--The attribute value was missing quotation marks (""). Without quotes, the HTML parser may misinterpret the value or fail to apply it correctly, leading to unexpected behavior.-->
<h2>Wonderful Wool</h2>                                          <!--The HTML tag wasn‚Äôt properly closed because it was missing a forward slash (/). This can cause rendering issues or unexpected behavior, especially with self-closing tags like <img> or <br>.-->
<p>Alpaca wool is light, warm, and water-resistant. It's sheared every year to make cozy clothing.</p>    <!--A <p> tag was missing, so the text wasn‚Äôt wrapped in a valid block-level element. This can prevent the browser from rendering the text properly or cause layout issues due to unexpected parsing.-->

<div class="wool-box">
<p>This box demonstrates <strong>absolute positioning</strong>.</p>       <!--An extra <p> tag was present, causing the following text to be incorrectly nested inside it. Without a proper closing tag, the browser may not know where the paragraph ends, potentially disrupting layout and rendering.-->
<div class="wool-detail">
<p>I'm a smaller box positioned inside the larger one!</p>                <!--A starting <p> tag was missing, so the text wasn‚Äôt enclosed in a valid HTML element. Without it, the browser may not render the text correctly or could ignore it entirely, leading to display issues.-->

<li>Alpacas can live up to 20 years.</li>                        <!--A closing </li> tag was missing, which caused the list item to remain open. This can confuse the browser‚Äôs parser and lead to layout or nesting issues in the rest of the list.-->
<li>They rarely spit at people ‚Äî only other alpacas!</li>
<li>Each alpaca has a unique ‚Äúhum‚Äù sound.</li> </li>
