     <a href="https://www.roblox.com/">Roblox Platform</a>
    <p>As you know, Roblox has suffered through multiple bans on various countries. This happened becuase of a recent event where they found that Roblx has 2000-3000 moderators for almost 100 million active users.</p>
    <p>This results in a ratio of 0.2-0.3 moderators per 1k people. Compared to places like Discord, has 0.5-1 moderator per 1k people even though Discord has much more people.</p>
    <p>They both deal with problems such as predators and oddballs, however Roblox tends to want to maximize profit to keep the investors happy and relies more on faulty AI moderation, banning thousands of innocent players.</p>
