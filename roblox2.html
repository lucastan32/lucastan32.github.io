     <a href="https://www.roblox.com/">Roblox Platform</a>
    <p>As you know, Roblox has suffered through multiple bans on various countries. This happened becuase of a recent event where they found that Roblx has 2000-3000 moderators for almost 100 million active users. This results in a ratio of 0.2-0.3 moderators per 1k people. Compared to places like Discord, has 0.5-1 moderator per 1k people even though Discord has much more people. They both deal with problems such as predators and oddballs, however Roblox tends to want to maximize profit to keep the investors happy and relies more on faulty AI moderation, banning thousands of innocent players.</p>
<p>With all that being said, there are some pedophile hunters on the platform that post videos catching them with the police:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Shlep</li>
      <li>JiDion</li>
      <li>And many other anonymous creators</li>
    </ol>
    <p>For these people you would think catching predators is a good thing right? Shlep himself helped in 6 police arrests, then got banned? Apparently Roblox doesn't want so called <em>"Vigilante Groups"</em> doing things like this for money even though <em>they won't fix their own problem</em>em>. This surfaced many unhappy users, as many people utilized tags, with the most popular one being <strong>#FREESHLEP</strong>, and Roblox even started banning users that used this tag.</p>
